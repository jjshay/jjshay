# Hi, I'm John

I build AI-powered automation for e-commerce and content workflows.

## What I Build

### AI Insights Engine
Multi-model consensus systems using GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, and Perplexity. Results are only trusted when 4+ models agree.

### Photo to Listing
Drop in product images, get complete marketplace listings with AI-generated titles, descriptions, pricing, and SEO tags.

### Visual Content Pipeline
Mockup generation, detail cropping, Ken Burns videos - all from a single product photo.
