# Hi, I'm John

I build AI-powered automation for e-commerce, content, and data workflows.

## What I Build

### AI Insights Engine
Multi-model consensus systems using GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, and Perplexity. Results are only trusted when 4+ models agree.

### AI Radar
Swipe-based content discovery with voice AI, LinkedIn carousel generation, and real-time news scoring.
