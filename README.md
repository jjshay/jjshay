# Hi, I'm John

I build AI-powered automation for e-commerce and content workflows.

### What I Build

**AI Insights Engine** - Multi-model consensus systems using GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, and Perplexity. Results are only trusted when 4+ models agree.

**Photo to Listing** - Drop in product images, get complete marketplace listings with AI-generated titles, descriptions, pricing, and SEO tags.

**Visual Content Pipeline** - Mockup generation, detail cropping, Ken Burns videos - all from a single product photo.
