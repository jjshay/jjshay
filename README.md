# Hi, I'm John

I build AI automation systems for e-commerce and content workflows.

### What I Work On

**Multi-AI Consensus** - Systems that use 4-5 AI models (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity) and only trust results when they agree. Used for news scoring, image analysis, and document verification.

**E-commerce Automation** - Tools that turn product images into complete listings with AI-generated titles, descriptions, and pricing across eBay, Etsy, and Shopify.

**Image Processing** - Pipelines for mockup generation, detail cropping, and video creation from still images.
